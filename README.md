# KNN Pokemon Classification

This project implements a basic K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classifying Pokemon types using their stats. The implementation is done from scratch without using any machine learning libraries.

## Dataset

The project uses the Pokemon database, which is publicly available and will be uploaded to the project's GitHub repository.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the main script: `python knn_pokemon.py`

## Project Structure

- `knn_pokemon.py`: Main script containing the KNN implementation and analysis
- `pokemon_database.csv`: Dataset file
- `README.md`: This file


## Notes

- No machine learning libraries are used in the KNN implementation
- The project explores the relationship between the 'k' parameter and overfitting
